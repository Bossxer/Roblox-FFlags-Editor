## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/Showcase.PNG)

The reason I made this was cause I saw a other FFlag editor and you needed [bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap) install to actually use it, so I decided to try and make on where you didn't need bloxstrap installed. NOTE: the one where you need bloxstrap might and is probably better than mine.
